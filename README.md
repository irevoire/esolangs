Esolangs
========

This repository provides interpretor for some common esoterics language.

Right now there is an implementation for:
- [Brainfuck](./brainfuck)
- [Argh!](./Argh!)
- [Befunge](./befunge)


Testing the code
----------------

I wrote everything in rust using cargo.
If you want to run anything just [install rustup and cargo](https://rustup.rs).

Once cargo is installed you can `cd` into any directory and run `cargo run`.
In every directory you should have a `code_sample` directory with code samples
for the language you are looking.
